## Setup

This project was developed and tested in Python 3.10+. We recommend using a virtual environment.

The only necessary package is `numpy`. `pip-tools` is an optional but recommended command line tool we use to manage package and subpackage versions.

**To install the necessary requirements, use `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the command line.**

If you change the requirements, you can rerun that command to install the new packages, or use `pip-sync` from pip-tools in the command line to also uninstall unnecessary packages or versions. If you need to add new packages, you can add them to `requirements.txt` directly, or just put the package name in `requirements.in` and use `pip-compile` from pip-tools in the command line to autogenerate a requirements file that ensures all package and subpackage versions work well with each other.

## Usage

After insalling necessary packages, run the algorithm by using `python3 src/main.py` in the command line. 

To change parameters of the genetic algorithm, go to the bottom of `main.py` and alter the arguments passed into the `run_ga` function.
